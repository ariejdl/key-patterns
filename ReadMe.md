Key Patterns from Celtic Knotwork, experimentation from George Bain's book

##notes

notice there are bifurcations in some key patterns

```

the patterns seems to consist in
symmetries and repetitions
including rotational symmetries

...representing these key patterns as a graph
would allow creation of loops (e.g. circular key patterns)

...one form of simple rendering could be simply drawing all edges

...node keys could simply be their coordinates
e.g. (0,0), (1,0)

...all edges must move only a maximum of one space
